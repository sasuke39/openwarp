# open-warp

Run your own LLM inside Warp. `open-warp` is a local, open-source adapter that connects a patched Warp terminal to any OpenAI-compatible provider, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter, LM Studio, vLLM, and more.

**How it works:** WarpLocal patches the Warp client to route AI requests to a local Go server instead of Warp's cloud backend. The server translates Warp's protobuf protocol into OpenAI-compatible API calls, executes supported local tools, and streams responses back to the client.

Documentation: [https://sasuke39.github.io/open-warp/](https://sasuke39.github.io/open-warp/)

## Features

- Works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter, vLLM, and LM Studio
- Drop-in `WarpLocal.app`: double-click to launch, no command line required
- Built-in local settings UI for provider, API key, and model configuration
- CJK input support: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text is recognized as AI queries
- Coexists with the official Warp app

## Supported Tools

`read_files` · `grep` · `file_glob` · `file_glob_v2` · `run_shell_command` · `read_shell_command_output` · `transfer_shell_command_control_to_user` · `apply_file_diffs` · `search_codebase`

Not yet supported: MCP tools, subagents, computer use, passive suggestions.

## Install

### Option A: Download Release (Recommended)

```bash
sh ./install.sh
```

Downloads the latest `WarpLocal.app` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sasuke39/open-warp/releases) and installs it.

> **macOS says the app is damaged?** Browser-downloaded unsigned apps can be blocked by Gatekeeper. Clear the quarantine attribute with:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/WarpLocal.app
> ```
> Installing with `sh ./install.sh` handles this automatically.

### Option B: Build from Source

Prerequisites: Go 1.22+, Rust toolchain, [Warp source](https://github.com/nicohman/warp) (v0.2026.04.29)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/sasuke39/open-warp.git
cd open-warp

# 2. Build the WarpLocal app bundle
WARP_SRC=/path/to/warp-source sh ./build_and_bundle.sh
open ./WarpLocal.app
```

See **[WARP_CLIENT.md](./WARP_CLIENT.md)** for the full patch and build guide.

## Troubleshooting

If WarpLocal crashes or behaves unexpectedly, generate diagnostics:

```bash
# If you have the repo:
sh ./install.sh doctor

# If you only have the app:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasuke39/open-warp/main/diagnostics.sh)
```

Then open a [bug report](https://github.com/sasuke39/open-warp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) and paste the generated summary.

See **[Troubleshooting](./docs/guide/troubleshooting.md)** for more help.

## How to Use

1. Download and open `WarpLocal.app`.
2. Open Warp's native **Settings → Local Adapter** page.
3. Select your provider and fill in the base URL, API key, and model name.
4. Save the settings. The local adapter reloads automatically.
5. Go back to WarpLocal, press `Cmd+K`, and ask the terminal to help.

Example prompts:

```text
Analyze this directory.
Explain this error and suggest a fix.
Create a simple text file.
Find the server entry point and summarize how it works.
```

`WarpLocal.app` starts the local adapter helper for you. You do not need to run a separate server for normal use.

## Configuration

Runtime config is stored in `config.yaml` (or `~/Library/Application Support/WarpLocal/config.yaml` for bundled apps).

```yaml
provider: openai-compatible
base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
model: gpt-4.1-mini
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 18888
```

For normal use, configure everything from Warp's native **Settings → Local Adapter** page. The YAML file is mainly useful for debugging or automation. The adapter no longer serves a browser-based settings page.

## Warp Client Patches

The `patches/` directory contains the Warp client patches:

| Patch | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0001 | `WarpServerConfig::local_adapter()` — routes requests to `127.0.0.1:18888` |
| 0002 | `Channel::Local` entrypoint — activates local adapter config |
| 0003 | Skip Firebase auth — local adapter doesn't need cloud auth |
| 0004 | CJK natural language detection — Chinese/Japanese/Korean input recognized as AI queries |
| 0005 | Native **Settings → Local Adapter** menu entry in Warp UI |
| 0006 | Skip onboarding for local adapter builds |
| 0007 | Gracefully stop the adapter helper when WarpLocal exits |
| 0012 | Replace the legacy browser page with native provider and Agent Harness settings |

See **[WARP_CLIENT.md](./WARP_CLIENT.md)** for details on each patch.

## App Bundle Structure

```
WarpLocal.app/
└── Contents/
    ├── MacOS/warp                # WarpLocal main binary
    ├── Helpers/warp-local-adapter # Go AI backend server
    ├── Helpers/node-runtime       # Runtime for bundled external harnesses
    └── Resources/
        ├── config.example.yaml
        ├── pi-runtime/
        ├── dsh-runtime/
        └── iconfile.icns
```

The Warp client manages the adapter server lifecycle: it starts the helper automatically and keeps it running.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
gofmt -w ./cmd ./internal
```

## Roadmap

1. `ask_user_question` tool support
2. Better `apply_file_diffs` failure reporting
3. Improved long-running shell command behavior
4. CI-based release automation
