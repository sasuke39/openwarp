## What is open-warp?

Warp's client is open source, but its AI backend is still controlled by the official cloud service. `open-warp` fills that gap with a local adapter server.

The project ships two parts:

- `OpenWarp.app`: a patched Warp app bundle that sends AI traffic to `127.0.0.1:18888`.
- `warp-local-adapter`: a Go backend that translates Warp's protobuf stream into OpenAI-compatible chat completions.

## Current status

`open-warp` is usable for the core coding loop: ask, inspect files, search, run commands, apply diffs, and continue with tool results. It does not yet aim for complete Warp backend parity.
